Highlights

- First framework unifying fractal decomposition, Banach contraction convergence, meta-circular self-optimization, and static purity analysis for program transformation.
- Energy-guarded morphism application structurally guarantees optimization convergence with proven contraction factor k=0.7989.
- Purity-aware automatic memoization via AST analysis converts O(2^n) to O(n) complexity, achieving up to 39,072x speedup on dynamic programming.
- Geometric mean speedup of 6.755x on 17 core functions and 3.402x across 41 diverse large-scale functions (9 categories), with 100% correctness on all 58 benchmarks.
- Aitken delta-squared acceleration reduces fixed-point iteration count by up to 12.3x on standard contractions.
