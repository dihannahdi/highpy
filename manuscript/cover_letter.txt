Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit an original research article entitled "Recursive Fractal Optimization Engine: Banach Contraction Convergence Guarantees and Automatic Memoization for Python Program Optimization" for consideration for publication in the Journal of Systems and Software.

This manuscript presents the Recursive Fractal Optimization Engine (RFOE), a novel framework for automated Python program optimization that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to unify fractal self-similar decomposition, Banach contraction mapping convergence guarantees, meta-circular self-optimization, and static purity analysis in a single system.

The key contributions are:

1. A fractal optimization architecture where programs are decomposed into a six-level hierarchy with universal optimization morphisms applied self-similarly at every level—the first application of fractal self-similarity as an organizing principle for compiler optimization.

2. Formal convergence guarantees via Banach's Contraction Mapping Theorem, providing the first quantitative convergence proof (existence, uniqueness, geometric rate bounds, iteration count bounds) for iterative AST optimization.

3. Purity-aware automatic memoization using a novel static purity analyzer that classifies functions into a four-level lattice (PURE, READ_ONLY, LOCALLY_IMPURE, IMPURE), enabling safe automatic memoization that converts O(2^n) to O(n) complexity.

4. Comprehensive experimental validation with 266 unit tests and 58 benchmark functions spanning nine real-world categories, demonstrating a 6.755× geometric mean speedup on 17 core functions, 3.402× across 41 diverse large-scale functions, peak 39,072× speedup on dynamic programming, and a formally proven pipeline contraction factor of k = 0.7989 < 1 at 100% confidence.

This work is significant for the systems and software community because it bridges the gap between theoretical computer science (metric-space fixed-point theory, fractal geometry) and practical program optimization, providing both formal guarantees and substantial empirical performance improvements. The framework is implemented as 4,300+ lines of Python code integrated into the HighPy optimization system.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. The author has approved the manuscript and agrees to its submission.

I confirm that:
- The manuscript is original and has not been published previously.
- The manuscript is not being considered for publication elsewhere.
- All data and materials are available for verification.
- There are no competing interests to declare.
- The use of generative AI tools has been properly declared.

I believe this paper is well suited for the Journal of Systems and Software given its focus on software systems, program optimization, and formal methods applied to practical software engineering problems.

Thank you for considering this manuscript. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Farid Dihan Nahdi
